# Project Improvements

This document outlines the key improvements, security enhancements, and discrepancy fixes applied to this project.

## Summary of Changes

The primary goal of these changes was to enhance the security, reliability, and user-friendliness of the Matrix self-hosting setup. The original configuration contained several hardcoded values, default credentials, and a setup process that was prone to error.

The following key areas were addressed:
1.  **Automated and Secure Configuration**: The `setup.sh` script was significantly improved to automate the generation of all necessary secrets and to detect server-specific settings.
2.  **Removal of Hardcoded Values**: Hardcoded IP addresses and default passwords have been removed from the `docker-compose.yml` file.
3.  **Improved Documentation**: The `README.md` has been updated to reflect the new, streamlined setup process.

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. Security Enhancements

-   **Removed Default PostgreSQL Password**:
    -   **Issue**: The `docker-compose.yml` file contained a default password (`changeme123`) for the PostgreSQL database. If a user did not use the `setup.sh` script or forgot to change it, the database would be left with a weak, publicly known password.
    -   **Fix**: The default password was removed from `docker-compose.yml`. The `setup.sh` script now generates a strong, random password and saves it to the `.env` file, which is the single source of truth for configuration.

-   **Removed Default LiveKit Credentials**:
    -   **Issue**: The `livekit` and `lk-jwt-service` services had default `devkey` and `devsecret` values.
    -   **Fix**: These defaults were removed. The `setup.sh` script now generates secure, random keys for LiveKit and adds them to the `.env` file.

-   **Secured LiveKit JWT Service Connection**:
    -   **Issue**: The `lk-jwt-service` was configured to connect to the LiveKit server over an insecure `ws://` (WebSocket) connection.
    -   **Fix**: The connection URL has been changed to `wss://` (Secure WebSocket) and is now dynamically configured using the `MATRIX_DOMAIN` variable, ensuring an encrypted connection.

### 2. Configuration and Reliability Fixes

-   **Dynamic Coturn (TURN Server) IP Configuration**:
    -   **Issue**: The `coturn` service in `docker-compose.yml` had a hardcoded public IP address (`95.216.155.153`), which would cause voice and video calls to fail for any user not running the server on that specific IP.
    -   **Fix**: The `coturn` service was modified to use an `EXTERNAL_IP` environment variable. The `setup.sh` script now automatically detects the server's public IP and sets this variable. This makes the voice and video call functionality work out-of-the-box for most users.

-   **Automated LiveKit Secret Generation**:
    -   **Issue**: The original `setup.sh` script did not generate the `LIVEKIT_KEY` and `LIVEKIT_SECRET` required for Element Call. Users had to generate them manually, which was not documented clearly.
    -   **Fix**: The `setup.sh` script now automatically generates these secrets and adds them to the `.env` file, completing the automated setup process.

-   **Removed Unused Docker Volumes**:
    -   **Issue**: The `docker-compose.yml` file defined `coturn_data` and `element_call_config` volumes that were not actually used by any service. This could cause confusion and wasted disk space.
    -   **Fix**: The unused volume definitions have been removed to keep the configuration clean and accurate.

### 3. Documentation Improvements

-   **Updated `README.md`**:
    -   **Issue**: The documentation was out of sync with the actual configuration. It contained misleading instructions about manual setup, IP configuration, and secret generation.
    -   **Fix**: The `README.md` has been extensively rewritten to guide users through the improved `setup.sh` script. The "Quick Start" and "Configuration" sections are now clear, concise, and accurate, leading to a much better user experience.
